# 🤖 Smart Path-Following Robot using A* Algorithm and Arduino

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **autonomous path navigation** using an **A* pathfinding algorithm** running on a **Raspberry Pi (or PC)** that communicates with an **Arduino-based robot**.  
The system takes an occupancy grid map (previously generated by an ultrasonic mapping system), computes the **shortest path** between a start and goal position, and sends **movement and rotation commands** to the Arduino for real-world motion.

This project builds upon the previous **Ultrasonic Mapping System**, where the environment was scanned and saved as `lab8_map.csv`.

⚙️ System Architecture
Module	Function
Arduino (sketch_nov03b.ino)	Receives serial commands (ROTATE x, MOVE y) and controls the robot’s motors to perform movement and rotation.
Python (joshua.py)	Loads a pre-mapped occupancy grid (lab8_map.csv), performs A* pathfinding from START to GOAL, and sends step-by-step commands to the Arduino.

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ Map Loading
The Python script loads the occupancy grid file lab8_map.csv generated from the ultrasonic mapping phase.

Grid cells with values ≥ 0.8 are treated as obstacles.

2️⃣ Path Planning (A* Algorithm)
The script defines START and GOAL coordinates.

Uses the A* algorithm to compute the shortest path.

The resulting path is a sequence of grid points avoiding obstacles.

3️⃣ Motion Command Generation
Each movement step is converted into rotation and forward movement commands:

php-template
Copy code
ROTATE <angle>
MOVE <distance>
These commands are sent to the Arduino over serial at 9600 baud.

4️⃣ Robot Execution
The Arduino receives each command and:

Rotates the robot by the specified angle.

Moves forward by the specified cell distance (e.g., 20 cm).

After completing the path, the robot stops.

🧠 Code Description
joshua.py
Loads map from lab8_map.csv.

Uses A* algorithm to find the optimal path:

Each node represents a cell in the occupancy grid.

Uses diagonal and straight movements with appropriate cost.

Sends movement commands to Arduino via serial (/dev/ttyACM0).

Visualizes the path over the map using Matplotlib.

Key Features

Heuristic: Euclidean distance

Obstacle threshold: 0.8

Adjustable grid size and movement delay

Automatic path visualization

sketch_nov03b.ino
Receives commands from Python through Serial communication.

Parses incoming commands (ROTATE or MOVE).

Controls DC motors using an L298N driver for:

Differential rotation (turn left/right).

Forward movement based on time or encoder feedback.

Designed for easy integration with path-planning scripts.

🧪 Running the Project
Step 1: Upload Arduino Code
Open sketch_nov03b.ino in Arduino IDE.

Connect your Arduino via USB.

Upload the code and ensure it is ready to receive serial commands.

Step 2: Run Python Program
Make sure lab8_map.csv exists in the same directory.

Edit START, GOAL, and PORT in joshua.py if necessary.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python3 joshua.py
Observe:

The A* path visualization on-screen.

Robot Motion
The robot executes rotation and move commands step by step:

python-repl
Copy code
ROTATE 90 → MOVE 20
ROTATE -45 → MOVE 20
